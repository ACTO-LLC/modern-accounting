    Reports turn your transaction data into useful insights. Key reports include:

    - **Profit & Loss (Income Statement)**: Revenue minus expenses = profit
    - **Balance Sheet**: Assets, liabilities, and equity at a point in time
    - **Cash Flow**: Where cash came from and where it went
    - **Accounts Receivable Aging**: Who owes you and for how long
    - **Accounts Payable Aging**: What you owe and when it's due

    These reports help you make decisions, file taxes, and show stakeholders
    how your business is doing.
