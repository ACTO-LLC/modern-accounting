  detailed: |
    Tax Settings lets you choose how sales tax rates are determined for invoices
    and other transactions. You can:
    - Use manual selection from your configured tax rates
    - Enable automatic ZIP code-based tax lookup (free)
    - Connect to paid tax APIs for street-level accuracy (Avalara, TaxJar)

    Proper tax configuration ensures you collect the right amount of sales tax
    and stay compliant with state and local tax requirements.

capabilities:
  - "Choose between manual, ZIP-based, or paid API tax calculation"
  - "Configure Avalara AvaTax or TaxJar credentials"
  - "Set a fallback tax rate for when API lookup fails"
  - "Test API connections before saving"
  - "Control how long tax rates are cached"

experienceLevelNotes:
  beginner: "Start with manual tax selection - pick a single rate that applies to most of your sales. You can upgrade to automatic calculation later."
  intermediate: "If you sell to customers in different states or cities, the ZIP-based API can automatically determine the correct rate."
  advanced: "For businesses with complex multi-state tax obligations, paid APIs like Avalara provide street-level accuracy and handle special tax rules."
