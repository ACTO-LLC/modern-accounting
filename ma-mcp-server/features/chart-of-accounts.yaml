  detailed: |
    The Chart of Accounts is like a filing system for your money. Every dollar
    that moves through your business gets categorized into an account:

    - **Assets**: Things you own (cash, equipment, money owed to you)
    - **Liabilities**: Things you owe (loans, credit cards, bills to pay)
    - **Equity**: Your ownership stake (what's left after liabilities)
    - **Income/Revenue**: Money coming in from sales
    - **Expenses**: Money going out for business costs

    This structure is the foundation of all accounting and financial reports.
