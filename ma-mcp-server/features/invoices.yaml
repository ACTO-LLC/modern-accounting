  short: "Bill your customers for products and services"
  detailed: |
    An invoice is a bill you send to customers requesting payment for products
    or services. When you create an invoice:
    - It records what the customer owes you
    - It increases your Accounts Receivable
    - It records revenue for your business

    Invoices are essential for tracking who owes you money and when payments are due.
