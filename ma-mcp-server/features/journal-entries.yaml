  short: "The foundation of double-entry bookkeeping"
  detailed: |
    Journal entries are how accountants record transactions directly. Every
    financial event is recorded with at least two lines:
    - One account is DEBITED (increased for assets/expenses, decreased for liabilities/equity/income)
    - One account is CREDITED (the opposite)

    The total debits must ALWAYS equal total credits - this keeps the books balanced.

    Most of the time, MA creates journal entries automatically (when you create
    invoices, bills, etc.). Manual journal entries are for adjustments, corrections,
    or special transactions.

capabilities:
  - "Create manual journal entries"
  - "View auto-generated entries from transactions"
  - "Make adjusting entries"
  - "Reverse entries"
  - "Search entry history"

accountingConcepts:
  - term: "Double-Entry Bookkeeping"
    explanation: "Every transaction affects at least two accounts. Money doesn't appear or disappear - it moves between accounts."
  - term: "Debits and Credits"
    explanation: "These are the two sides of every entry. Debits increase assets and expenses; Credits increase liabilities, equity, and income."
  - term: "Balanced Entry"
    explanation: "Total debits must equal total credits. If they don't match, something is wrong."
