  detailed: |
    Estimates (also called quotes or proposals) let you give customers a price
    before they commit to buying. Key points:
    - Estimates don't affect your books until converted to an invoice
    - Customers can review and approve estimates
    - Approved estimates can be converted to invoices with one click

    This helps you win business while keeping accurate records.
